## 🎯 The Problem

Many websites—government portals, educational platforms, healthcare services—present significant barriers to neurodivergent users through complex jargon, distracting animations, and overwhelming text layouts that create cognitive friction.

## ✨ The Solution

InclusiveRead leverages AI and advanced accessibility features to make any webpage more accessible with four powerful modes:

### 1. **Jargon Decoder** 📖
AI-powered text simplification that makes complex content understandable:
- **Full Page Decode**: Toggle on to automatically detect and simplify complex legal, financial, technical, medical, government, and academic terms across the entire page
- **Selection Decoder**: Select any text (10-5000 characters) and click "Decode" in the floating toolbar to decode just that portion with inline tooltips
- **Text Simplification**: Select text and click "Simplify" to get a complete plain-English rewrite
- Replaces jargon with plain-English definitions in interactive tooltips
- Preserves original formatting while adding helpful hover explanations
- Smart context-aware simplifications with category labels and difficulty ratings
- Visual progress indicator during AI analysis

### 2. **Dyslexia Reading Mode** 📚
Comprehensive reading support optimized for dyslexic users:
- **Dyslexia-Friendly Fonts**: OpenDyslexic, Arial, or Comic Sans
- **Customizable Letter Spacing**: Adjustable spacing for easier character recognition (0-5px)
- **Enhanced Line Height**: Configurable line spacing to reduce crowding (1.0-3.0)
- **Word Spacing Control**: Increased word spacing for better word distinction (0-10px)
- **Color Overlays**: Tinted overlays (beige, light blue, light green, light yellow) to reduce visual stress
- **Bionic Reading**: Bold first letters to guide eye movement and improve reading speed
- All settings persist across sessions

### 3. **Sensory Shield** 🛡️
Reduces sensory overload and distractions:
- Freezes CSS animations and transitions
- Pauses auto-playing videos and GIFs
- Stops flashing and blinking elements
- Prevents sensory overwhelm from moving content
- Creates a calmer browsing experience

### 4. **Text-to-Speech** 🔊
Advanced read-aloud functionality with visual tracking:
- **Playback Controls**: Play, pause, and stop reading
- **Voice Selection**: Choose from available system voices (auto-selects best quality)
- **Adjustable Speed**: Choose from very slow to very fast (0.5x - 1.5x)
- **Volume Control**: Adjustable volume level (0-100%)
- **Smart Punctuation Pauses**: Natural pauses at commas, periods, and other punctuation
- **Word Highlighting**: Visual tracking that highlights the current word being read
- **Content Selection**: Automatically reads main page content
- Browser-native TTS engine (no external dependencies)
